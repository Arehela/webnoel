<p>George Raymond Richard Martin (born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948),
  often referred to as George R. R. Martin, is an American novelist and short-story
  writer in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres, screenwriter, and television
  producer. He is best known for his series of epic fantasy novels, A Song of Ice and Fire,
  which was later adapted into the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011–present). Martin serves
  as the series's co-executive producer, and also scripted four episodes of the series.

<p>In 2005, Lev Grossman of Time called Martin "the American Tolkien", and in 2011, he was
   included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.
   George Raymond Martin (he later adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)
   was born on September 20, 1948, in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of longshoreman
   Raymond Collins Martin and his wife Margaret Brady Martin. He has two younger sisters,
   Darleen and Janet. His father was of half Italian descent, while his mother was of half
   Irish ancestry. He also has French, English, Welsh and German roots. </p>

<p>The family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother.
   In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. During Martin's
   childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his
   grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other
   places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, so he became a voracious
   reader. The young Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other
   neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical
   kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so
   he finally decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".</p>

<p>Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and then later Marist High School. While there he
  became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published
  by Marvel Comics. A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue
  No. 20 (Nov 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., FF #32, #34, and others. Fans who read
  his letters then wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the
  fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;] he was the first
  to register for an early comic book convention held in New York in 1964.In 1965, Martin
  won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best fan fiction for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs.
  The Blue Barrier".</p>

<p>In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in Journalism from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois,
   graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from
   Northwestern. Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin
   applied for and obtained conscientious objector status; he instead did alternative service
   work for two years (1972–1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance
   Foundation. An expert chess player, he also directed chess tournaments for the Continental
   Chess Association from 1973 to 1976. </p>
